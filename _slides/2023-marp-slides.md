<!-- A slide with a title -->
# These are some sample markdown slides

---

<!-- Three dash breaks start a new slide -->
<!-- This one just has some text and a link -->

They're created using [marp](https://marp.app/)

<!-- Another slide with some bullet points -->

* They're rendered from markdown to HTML using the [marp-cli docker container](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli#docker).

* The rendered slides are deployed as part of my website.

* This happens in a [github action](https://github.com/UnseenWizzard/unseenwizzard.github.io/blob/8d812ca33bfac4106ddf5f58512740e925c835fa/.github/workflows/render-slides.yaml).
