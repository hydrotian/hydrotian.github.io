Hello, I'm Tian, an earth scientist at [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/) in Washington State, USA. I received my MS degree from [Lanzhou University](https://en.lzu.edu.cn/), China, majoring Quaternary Geology. In 2007 I came to the US and got my PhD degree from the State University of New York, College of Environmental Science and Forestry ([SUNY-ESF](https://www.esf.edu/)) Water Resources Engineering program. After spending three years as a postdoc in the Land Surface Hydrology Group in the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/), I joined my current institute as a postdoc and later a staff scientist.

My research interests are hydrological processes across different spatial and temporal scales. Some examples of my past/ongoing research topics are:

- When did Yellow River cut off the Shanxi-Shaanxi George and why? (Lanzhou University)
- How does river restoration structure change surface flow hydrodynamics and hyporheic flows? (SUNY-ESF)
- Can we use TRMM near-real-time product for flood forecast? (University of Washington)
- How does man-made reservoir variations compare with natural water storage (e.g. soil moisture, SWE) variations globally? (University of Washington)
- How does upstream dam operations alter hyporheic exchange patterns in Columbia River? (PNNL)
- What is future hydropower generation going to look like in USA? (PNNL)
- Evaluating irrigation water allocations from surface and groundwater sources. (PNNL)
- Quantifying spatial and temporal patterns of global floods. (PNNL)
- Coupling land-ocean-river components in an earth system model. (PNNL)

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, biking, and traveling. I am also a passionate landscape photographer who takes great joy from capturing the beauty of the mother nature. Some of my works can be found [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tizhou/albums).
