title: "The DOE E3SM v1. 1 biogeochemistry configuration: description and simulated ecosystem_climate responses to historical changes in forcing"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-E3SM-BGC
excerpt: 'This paper documents the biogeochemistry configuration of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), E3SMv1.1_BGC. The model simulates historical carbon cycle dynamics, including carbon losses predicted in response to land use and land cover change, and the responses of the carbon cycle to changes in climate'
