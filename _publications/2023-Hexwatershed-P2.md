title: "Topological Relationship-Based Flow Direction Modeling: Stream Burning and Depression Filling"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-Hexwatershed-P2
excerpt: 'This is the second part of a two-part study of building a comprehensive river network over any mesh provided. This paper introduces a workflow that consist of (a) a topological relationship-based hybrid breaching-filling method to conduct stream burning for the river network and (b) a modified depression removal method for rivers and hillslopes.'

This is the second part of a two-part study of building a comprehensive river network over any mesh provided. This paper introduces a workflow that consist of (a) a topological relationship-based hybrid breaching-filling method to conduct stream burning for the river network and (b) a modified depression removal method for rivers and hillslopes.
